# Logistic Regression for Diabetes Prediction

This Python project implements logistic regression for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on a given set of features. Below, you'll find instructions on how to run the code, its dependencies, dataset source, and a brief dataset description.

## Table of Contents

- [How to Run](#how-to-run)
- [Dataset Source](#dataset-source)
- [Dataset Description](#dataset-description)

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for train-test split)
- matplotlib (for data visualization, though not used in this code)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the relevant files.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

3. Run the code using Python:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of the Python script that contains the code.

4. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to perform the following actions:

   - Select an option:
     1) Evaluation
     2) Give input
     3) Exit Program

   - If you choose option 1 (Evaluation), the code will calculate and display the accuracy of the model based on test data.

   - If you choose option 2 (Give input), you can enter feature values to get a prediction for the binary outcome (0 or 1), indicating the likelihood of diabetes.

   - If you choose option 3 (Exit Program), the program will terminate.

Please ensure that you have a dataset in the CSV format (e.g., "diabetes.csv") with the target variable named 'Outcome' and other features.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find the dataset at the following URL:

[Diabetes Dataset ()](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)

## Dataset Description

The diabetes dataset contains various medical and demographic features, with the 'Outcome' column serving as the target variable. The 'Outcome' variable is binary, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of diabetes and 0 indicating the absence. Features include:

- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level (mg/dl)
- Blood pressure (mm/Hg)
- Skin thickness (0-99)
- Insulin level (mm)
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The code in this project trains a logistic regression model on this dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on these features.
